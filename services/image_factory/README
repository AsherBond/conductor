First, you'll need:
* rebuild the rpms for new qpid/qmf:
  http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=10015
* build rpm for oz (http://www.aeolusproject.org/oz-download.html)
* You can run imageFactory from src, or build the rpm, source is here:
  git://github.com/aeolusproject/image_factory

I have been developing for now using the following packages for qpid:
qpid-cpp-server-0.8-6.fc14.x86_64
python-qpid-qmf-0.8-6.fc14.x86_64
ruby-qpid-qmf-0.8-6.fc14.x86_64
qpid-tools-0.8-6.fc14.noarch
qpid-qmf-0.8-6.fc14.x86_64
qpid-cpp-client-0.8-6.fc14.x86_64
qpid-cpp-server-store-0.8-6.fc14.x86_64

Note that you will need to rpm -e --nodeps all older qpid stuff
if you dont want to uninstall the entire conductor stack.

Make sure /etc/qpidd.conf has the line:
auth=no
and restart qpidd service

Build the console gem and install:
[console]$ rake gem
[console]$ sudo gem install pkg/image_factory_console-0.2.0.gem

You can start the factory (from src) with:
[factory-checkout]$ sudo ./imgfac.py --qmf --foreground

In the console dir,
run tests with:
[console]$ rake spec

For the connector, build and install the gem:
[image_factory_connector]$ rake package
[image_factory_connector]$ sudo gem install pkg/#{connector-gem}

You can then start it anywhere, with:
$ image_factory_connector -p 2003 start

Alternatively, in the image_factory_connector/bin dir, run the app in any of the following ways:
* [image_factory_connector/bin]$ ./image_factory_connector -p 2003 start
* [image_factory_connector/lib]$ thin -R config.ru -p 2003 start
* [image_factory_connector/lib]$ ruby -r 'rubygems' image_factory_connector/image_factory_connector.rb

View some simple interactions (defined in image_factory_connector) from browser with:
http://localhost:2003/
http://localhost:2003/shutdown (note that this one shuts down the console, so you will need to restart
  connector if you run this)

The remaining 2 public methods are POST actions, so you can try them out with curl if you like.
