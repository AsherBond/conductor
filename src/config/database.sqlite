# SQLite version 3.x
#   gem install sqlite3-ruby (not necessary on OS X Leopard)

# If you are running the conductor from an rpm, and wish to use
# sqlite, you will need to mv this file to database.yml.  The .sqlite3 file can be put
# in any location you desire, just update the relative paths below to point
# to the correct location.  Also, you will need to take the following 2 steps:
# 1. Run rake db:migrate (as root) to create the db file and set it to be owned by the aeolus user
# 2. Make sure the dir that the above file lives in is also writable by this user.

# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
