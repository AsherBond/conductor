== Required gems ==

* gem install cinch nokogiri rest-client

== Setup ==

This bot uses cinch, which requires ruby 1.9.  If you are on Fedora, your
best bet for running cinch is:
* yum install rubygem-rvm (details on https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/)
* rvm-install
* follow the config directions
* set gnome terminal to activate it properly with:
  Edit -> Profile Preferences -> Title and Command, check 'Run command as login shell' box
* open a new terminal or tab
* rvm install 1.9.2
* rvm use 1.9.2
* check it with 'ruby -v'
* run the bot with 'ruby bot.rb'

== TODO ==

* Make the bot run as a daemon, add OptParser/wrapper script to support this
* Write a plugin to link up tickets in BZ to issues in redmine
* Make bot sign into freenode with a real user
* Set bot as an admin in #aeolus
* Add plugin to:
** op other users in channel
** tell user their open issues
** list status on a requested issue
** return percentage complete of current sprint(s)
** answer questions maybe?
** send a halibut to someone
